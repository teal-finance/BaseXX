# BaseXX

Go modules: &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/teal-finance/BaseXX.svg "Go documentation for BaseXX")](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/teal-finance/BaseXX)

[`import "github.com/teal-finance/BaseXX/base58"`](./base58/)  
[`import "github.com/teal-finance/BaseXX/base62"`](./base62/)  
[`import "github.com/teal-finance/BaseXX/base91"`](./base91/)  
[`import "github.com/teal-finance/BaseXX/base92"`](./base92/)  
[`import "github.com/teal-finance/BaseXX/xascii85"`](./xascii85/)  

Characters often used by common BaseXX encodings:

```
Hexa    0123456789ABCDEF
Base58   123456789ABCDEFGH JKLMN PQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijk mnopqrstuvwxyz
Base62  0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Base64  0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+/=
Base91  0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+/=*-_~.,?!@#$%&()[]{|}<>^:`'
Base92  0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+/=*-_~.,?!@#$%&()[]{|}<>^:`'"
```

## Fork of mr-tron/base58

Originally, BaseXX is a fork of <https://github.com/mr-tron/base58>
adapted to support other bases:

- [`base58`](./base58/)
- [`base62`](./base62/)
- [`base91`](./base91/)
- [`base92`](./base92/)
- [`xascii85`](./xascii85/)

All these packages, except `xascii85`,
support customized encoding alphabet
without any performance tradeoff.

The `xascii85` package is just a layer on top of `"encoding/ascii85"`
to provide the same API as the other packages.

## Common interface

All these packages aim to provide the following API
similar of `"encoding/ascii85"`:

```go
func NewEncoding(encoder string) *Encoding

interface Encoding  {
    Decode(dst, src []byte) (n int, err error)
    Encode(dst, src []byte) (n int)
    // Here Encode() returns the number of written bytes.
    // This is different with encoding/base64.
    // The encoded length cannot be known from just
    // the number of bytes to encode, whereas it can with Base64.

    DecodeString(s string) ([]byte, error)
    EncodeToString(src []byte) string

    DecodedLen(n int) int // Returns the Max.
    EncodedLen(n int) int // Returns the Max.

    // Not implemented.
    // Strict() *Encoding
    // WithPadding(padding rune) *Encoding
}
```

## Similar project

BaseXX is similar to [SmartGo](https://github.com/unix-world/smartgo)
from Radu Ovidiu Ilies who has adapted
<https://github.com/akamensky/base58> to support any base encoder:
BaseXX has adapted <https://github.com/mr-tron/base58>
to support other base encoders.

BaseXX shares with [SmartGo](https://github.com/unix-world/smartgo)
the ability to quickly create new base encoders,
by copying source files and changing few things.

Performance is similar for large input samples,
but for short inputs, BaseXX is faster.

To compare short inputs, see the [benchmark results](#benchmark).
To compare larger specific inputs, see the [`bench` command](examples/bench).

## Slower than Base91 by Joachim Henke and Michael Traver

The implementation [github.com/mtraver/base91](https://github.com/mtraver/base91)
is much cleaner and faster:

- Standard Encoding interface
- 190 times faster encoding
- 35 times faster decoding

See the [benchmark results](#benchmark).

## Compliance with cookie token standard

The default encoding alphabets of [BaseXX/base58](./base58/),
[BaseXX/base62](./base62/), [BaseXX/base91](./base91/)
and [BaseXX/base92](./base92/) conform with the
cookie token constraints:

- characters from 0x20 (space) to 0x7E (tilde `~`) included
- except three characters: double-quote `"`, semicolon `;` and backslash `\`

The [BaseXX/xascii85](./xascii85/) encoder
do not support these cookie token constraints
because it uses three forbidden ASCII characters:
double-quote (`"`), semicolon (`;`) and backslash (`\`).

## Compliance with Bearer token standard

The [RFC 6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.html#section-2.1)
is conservative and recommends to use the following 70 characters:

    0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+-./_~

## Usage

In the following example replace `base92` by
`base58`, `base62`, `base91` (or `xascii85`).

```go
package main

import "github.com/teal-finance/BaseXX/base92"

func main() {
    // Encode any binary data
    bin := []byte{12, 23, 24, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89}
    str := base92.Encode(bin)

    // Decode back
    bin, err := base92.Decode(str)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Use custom alphabet, not applicable for xascii85

    var noSpace = base92.NewEncoding(
        "!#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO" +
        "PQRSTUVWXYZ[]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~")

    txt := noSpace.EncodeToString(bin)
    bin, err = noSpace.DecodeString(txt)
}
```

## Benchmark

The benchmark shows this BaseXX project is almost faster than the
[original project](https://github.com/mr-tron/base58) on Base58.

## Can be much faster

Performance can be much much improved.
Using the tips of <https://github.com/mtraver/base91>
(original work from Joachim Henke),
this BaseXX repo may become 200 times faster on the encoding,
and 30 times faster on the decoding.

The repo <https://github.com/unix-world/smartgo> proposes many bases.

See the section [*Similar project*](#similar-project).

### Base91 by Joachim Henke and Michael Traver

This is the cleanest and fastest Base91 Go-implementation
of all the Base91 benched by this BaseXX project.

Michael Traver has ported to Go the excellent work from Joachim Henke.

Repo: <https://github.com/mtraver/base91>

### Base91 by Majestrate

Good Base91 implementation at
<https://github.com/majestrate/base91>.

No bugs found while benching it.

### Base91 by Equim

Good Base91 implementation at
<https://github.com/Equim-chan/base91-go>.

No bugs found while benching it.

### Base91 by Brad Proctor

The repo <https://github.com/bproctor/base91>
is a slow Base91 implementation.
Still faster than BaseXX/Base91.

No bugs found while benching it.

### Base91 by Antonino Catinello

The implementation by [Antonino Catinello](https://codeberg.org/ac)
contains bugs. Moreover, this Base91 implementation
does not accept customized encoding alphabet.

This repo contains a
[fork](<https://github.com/teal-finance/BaseXX/ac/base91>)
(almost unmodified) of <https://codeberg.org/ac/base91>.
The latter cannot be used because the module name
`"catinello.eu/base91"` is not reachable (tested in May 2022).

### Base91 by Chris Snell and Breeze Chen

The repo <https://github.com/breezechen/base91>
is an unmaintained and buggy Base91 implementation.
